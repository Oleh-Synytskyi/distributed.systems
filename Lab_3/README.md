I am create TCP client/server network using Python library sockets and threading.
Host server using instances clients objects and threads for listens to incoming data
from each clients

1. # Running Server
    - Download Host.py and Client_Server.py for Python
    - Run Host.py. The server starts and will be prompted to enter the host and port,
     and then clients can connect. The server also runs on a localhost and can connect to different computers and from other networks
     - Run Client_Server.py With the help of the client we can write messages  and enter commands. 
     With the help of the client we can access the server, enter the host, IP address and port
2. # Usage Client and Server
    We start the server and set the locale and port 8800, access the server, 
    also start the client, enter the host and port, and enter any message,
